  <title>Building packages with CDBS and the OCaml class</title>
  <para>
    To help maintainers of OCaml-related packages in adhering to this policy, a
    class for the <ulink url="http://build-common.alioth.debian.org/">CDBS
      build system</ulink> has been made available and is shipped as part of
    the <filename>ocaml</filename> package. Please consider using it in your
    packages at it will both ease your work and permit to perform changes to a
    wide range of packages acting on a single piece of software (the CDBS class
    itself).
  </para>

  <para>
    To use the class in your package it is enough to include the file
    <filename>/usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/ocaml.mk</filename> from your
    <filename>debian/rules</filename>. If you use debhelper (please do) you
    should include the OCaml class after the debhelper on. A typical
    <filename>debian/rules</filename> heading for a package using plain Makefile
    (i.e. no autotools) and dpatch is as follows:
    <programlisting>
  #!/usr/bin/make -f
  include /usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/dpatch.mk
  include /usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/debhelper.mk
  include /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/makefile.mk
  include /usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/ocaml.mk
    </programlisting>
    For an example of such a package see the <filename>pcre-ocaml</filename>
    Debian source package.
  </para>

  <para>
    A detailed description of how to use the OCaml CDBS class should be provided
    in this section, but at the time of writing is a future work :-). In the
    meantime if you know CDBS, the .mk files which compose the OCaml
    class are well commented and they should give you enough information to
    customize the build process of your package. The latest version of them is
    available in the repository of the &ocaml-force; and can be browsed on the
    web:
