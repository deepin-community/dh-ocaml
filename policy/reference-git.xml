    <title>Using Git for packaging</title>
    <para>
      This section is still under construction!
    </para>
    <para>
      (Hopefully) All OCaml-related Debian packages are maintained using
      centralized <ulink url="http://git-scm.com/">Git</ulink>
      repositories. This practice reduce the efforts needed to contribute
      work inside &ocaml-force; and, in case of need, provides a place
      where to massively perform changes to all OCaml-related Debian
      packages.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the past, we were using Subversion, but we are progressively
      migrating our packages to Git.
    </para>
    <para>
      Debian users can benefit knowing we are using a Git repository
      (they can for instance subscribe to the RSS feed for changes or
      have a place where to look for finding patches corresponding to
      bugs tagged "pending" in the BTS).
    </para>
    <para>
      For this reason <emphasis>it is recommended to add the
      <code>Vcs-Git</code> and <code>Vcs-Browser</code> fields to the
      <filename>debian/control</filename> of packages maintained in
      &ocaml-force; Git repository</emphasis>. Its name specifies that
      we are using Git as our Version Control System
      (<acronym>VCS</acronym>); their values are the URLs pointing to
      the package's repository and to a browsable view of the same
      directory. See the
      <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/best-pkging-practices.html#bpp-vcs">Debian
      Developer's Reference</ulink> for more information about these
      fields.
    </para>
    <para>
      The general scheme for using the fields are thus:
  <programlisting>  Vcs-Git: git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-ocaml-maint/packages/<emphasis>PACKAGE_NAME</emphasis>.git
    Vcs-Browser: http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-ocaml-maint/packages/<emphasis>PACKAGE_NAME</emphasis>.git
  </programlisting>

      <title>How to obtain a copy of a package's Git repository</title>
      <para>
        There is one Git repository per package. To get the list of packages managed with git, you
        can use the following command (your ssh must be configured properly):
  <programlisting>  ssh git.debian.org ls /git/pkg-ocaml-maint/packages
  </programlisting>

        You can obtain a copy of the repository for a package with:
  <programlisting>  checkout-d-o-m-git-repo package
  </programlisting>
        The <application>checkout-d-o-m-git-repos</application> script is
        available in the Subversion repository. You can get a copy with:
  <programlisting>  svn co svn://svn.debian.org/svn/pkg-ocaml-maint/trunk/projects/git-guide
  </programlisting>
        You must be member of the
        <ulink url="http://pkg-ocaml-maint.alioth.debian.org/">Debian
        OCaml Task Force</ulink> in order to have the right to push to the central repository.

  <section>
      <title>Structure of a Git repository</title>
      <para>
          We keep all upstream sources under Git control, in a branch
          called <emphasis>upstream</emphasis>. This branch usually
          consists of successive unpacked upstream tarballs. When
          importing a new upstream tarball, the following command should
          be used:
  <programlisting>  git-import-orig --pristine-tar [--no-dch] &lt;name_version.orig.tar.gz&gt;
  </programlisting>
          The <filename>--pristine-tar</filename> is mandatory to store
          information for reconstructing the upstream tarball from the
          repository. That information is not suited for human use and
          is stored in the <emphasis>pristine-tar</emphasis>
          branch. Optionally, <filename>--no-dch</filename> can be given
          to automatically update the Debian changelog (without
          committing it).
      </para>
      <para>
        The <emphasis>master</emphasis> branch contains upstream sources
        along with the <filename>debian/</filename>
        directory. <filename>git-import-orig</filename> automatically
        creates a (local) tag in the upstream branch, and
        merges <emphasis>upstream</emphasis>
        into <emphasis>master</emphasis> when importing a new
        tarball. Changes related to Debian should be done in this
        branch.
      </para>
  </section>

  <section>
      <title>How to add a new package</title>
      <para>
          Let's take <application>dose2</application> as an example. The
          following command (the <application>new-d-o-m-git-repo</application> is available at the same location of <application>checkout-d-o-m-git-repo</application>):
  <programlisting>  new-d-o-m-git-repo dose2 /some/where/dose2-1.2.tar.gz
  </programlisting>
          will create the remote repository on Alioth, set up
          notifications, and inject the given tarball in the repository
          in the <emphasis>upstream</emphasis> branch
          (using <filename>pristine-tar</filename>). More
          details <ulink url="http://wiki.debian.org/Alioth/Git">there</ulink>. You
          can then check it out and start using it.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the tarball name is
        missing, <application>new-d-o-m-git-repo</application> will
        check that the current directory is a git repository, and then
        push it to Alioth.  This allows you to create the repository
        locally, work on it, and only push it when it is in good
        shape. It is recommended to check it out after, and use the
        checked out version, to make sure everything went well, and to
        have local branches tracking remote ones.
      </para>
  </section>

  <section>
      <title>How to set up your package for use with <application>git-buildpackage</application></title>

      <para>
        Put the following in <filename>debian/gbp.conf</filename>:
  <programlisting>  # Configuration file for git-buildpackage and friends

    [DEFAULT]
    # the default branch for upstream sources:
    upstream-branch = upstream
    # the default branch for the debian patch:
    debian-branch = master
    # use pristine-tar:
    pristine-tar = True
  </programlisting>
          The first two settings are not really useful since they are
          the defaults, but it might be handy to have them around when
          working with several
          branches. The <filename>pristine-tar</filename> is necessary
          if tarballs are imported. Please see
          the <application>git-buildpackage</application> documentation
          for complete information.
      </para>

      <para>
          If you tried <application>git-buildpackage</application>
          before writing your <filename>debian/gbp.conf</filename>,
          remember to delete the <filename>.orig</filename> tarball, and
          rebuild <emphasis>after</emphasis>
          writing <filename>debian/gbp.conf</filename>. Alternatively,
          you can invoke <application>git-buildpackage</application>
          with the <filename>--git-pristine-tar</filename> option.
      </para>
  </section>

  <section>
      <title>How to build a package with <application>git-buildpackage</application></title>

      <para>
          Please refer to the <application>git-builpackage</application>
          documentation for more complete information. Here is just a
          quick guide.
      </para>

      <para>
          All options, except those starting on <option>--git</option>, are passed to
          <application>dpkg-buildpackage</application>. Hence, basic
          usage should be something like this (from the root of the
          repository): <command>git-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc
          -us</command>. The package will be built in place, and the
          result will be put in the parent directory.
      </para>

      <para>
        <application>git-buildpackage</application> will complain when
        your repository is not clean. You may use the
        option <option>--git-ignore-new</option> to override this
        behaviour.
      </para>

      <para>
          If your package is ready for upload you may use
          the <option>--git-tag</option> option for the final
          build. This will create a tag in your local repository.
          Provided you have commited all your changes to the Git
          repository, this will after a successful build of the package
          create a tag for the current version.
      </para>

      <tip>
          <para>
            Tags created by <application>git-import-orig</application>
            and <application>git-buildpackage</application> are not
            automatically pushed, you have to push them explicitly with
            the following command: <command>git push
            --tags</command>. Be careful if you use local tags!
          </para>
          <para>
            You can add the <command>--dry-run</command> option
            to <command>git push</command> to see what will be done.
          </para>
          <para>
            To build with <application>pbuilder</application>
            (or <application>cowbuilder</application>), use the
            following:
  <programlisting>  git-buildpackage \
      --git-builder="pdebuild --debbuildopts '-I.git -i\.git -uc -us'" \
      --git-cleaner="fakeroot debian/rules clean"
  </programlisting>
          </para>
      </tip>

      <title>Patches</title>
      <para>
        We have not yet decided on how to deal with patches in upstream
        (this topic is under discussion). Possibilities include direct
        commits in the <emphasis>master</emphasis> branch, use
        of <ulink url="http://repo.or.cz/w/topgit.git">TopGit</ulink>
        and quilt-serialized patches, and raw quilt or dpatch.
      </para>

      <section>
        <title>Quilt-serialized patches</title>

        <para>
          Patches can be serialized using Git. Two tools are used to
          apply and save the patches
